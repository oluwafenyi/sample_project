This repository also contains sample scripts and configurations for the deployment of the site.

* local.yml and production.yml are docker-compose configurations

* the docs directory contains guides to deploying and setting up on a production server
* the nginx directory contains sample nginx configs

### Installing Standalone Django Apps from Private Repositories
In this project I have included a custom django app to be installed directly from a git repository.
You will find a reference to it in `requirements/base.txt#L18`, pip has the ability to pull from
git repositories and install them provided they have been packaged correctly. (You can find django documentation on packaging
a standalone app here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/reusable-apps/)

Once your app has been packaged and committed to a repository you will be able to run it using

`pip install git+https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git`


Private repositories will require an access token with read access so the url will be a bit different:

`pip install git+https://<PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git`


You can find a sample django standalone app at https://github.com/oluwafenyi/sample_app.

### Running Locally
To run the site locally, run docker-compose -f local.yml up in the root directory
